#Android Alpha Team Help

##1. What is the current state of the application?
The application now contains a lot of features, but more are yet to come!

Some of our current features are:

 - ####A "mystats" screen that shows some statistics about the phone's connectivity. This screen needs some more work. Some of the data shown on this screen is still fake, although that will change very soon.Clicking on the "statistic bars" should bring up previous history on your phone.

 - #### A working livestatus screen
    - The percentometer shows the percentage of your signal. This should roughly correspond to the "signal bars" on top of your screen. (80%-100% corresponds to 5 bars, 60%-80% corresponds to 4 bars, etc.)
   - The chart shows the history of your phone's signal strength.

 - ####A working map screen
    - The map screen shows various events that have occured. On zooming out, the events are now clustered into groups. This leads to very good performance on the phone. Clicking on any of the event clusters brings up the list of events in that cluster.
    - The coverage map shows up as well

 - ####The phone now uploads data to the server

 - ####A speed test screen that is fresh is out of the oven. This is a very simple screen that lets the user run the speed test. This screen's usability will be increased in the upcoming updates.

##2. What will be added to the application in the future?
As mentioned before; the application does not yet have all of the features.
Some of the upcoming features are:

 - ####A screen that shows details of events when they are clicked on the map screen

 - ####Password Encryption

 - ####Neighbouring cell information

 - ####A better interface for the speed test screen

 - ####Variable activity depending on the profile selected (from the settings)

##3. How do I keep the application up-to-date?
The application is under heavy development, but it's not mature enough to be pushed to the Android App Market just yet. This means that we have no way of automatically updating the application on your phones. This, the easiest way for you to update the application is using dropbox.

Please send your dropbox username to Chelsea ([chelsea@cortxt.com](chelsea@cortxt.com.md)) and a dropbox folder with all of the Android APKs will be shared with you. This is am excellent way to install the application because a dropbox client for Android is available on the Android App Market. Using that application, installing the latest version of the MMC on your Android phone is a breeze. 

A copy of the APKs can also be accessed using the download button at the top right of the screen. From there you can choose the download that is right for you.

If you are currently using 0.3.0 you will need to first uninstall to download the most current version.

##4. What do I do when the application malfunctions?
Since the application is still in Alpha phase, it is bound to malfunction. The following sections explain what to do in such situations.
###4.1 When the application crashes
When the application crashes, a notification appears on the Android notification drawer. The application gracefully restarts so that its usability is relatively unaffected. 

![Unexpected error](file:///C:/Users/Owner/Desktop/!cid_part1_05000501_09020302@gmail.png)
*figure 1.* A crash causes a notification message to be displayed.

When this notification shows up, please expand the notification drawer and click on the crash notification, this should bring up the following screen. Use this screen to send comments to the developers.

![MMC has crashed](file:///C:/Users/Owner/Desktop/!cid_part2_08020901_01030809@gmail.png)  
*figure2.* Comments can be sent to the developers along with the other data (that is automatically recorded).

###4.2 When the application malfunctions but doesn't crash

Our github project page serves as an excellent place for filing issues with the application. 

Want to file issues, concerns, feature requests, or to just send a comment to our developers vis github?

You can find the issue link at [https://github.com/CORTxT/MMC Android Alpha/issues.md](https://github.com/CORTxT/MMCAndroidAlpha/issues.md)
